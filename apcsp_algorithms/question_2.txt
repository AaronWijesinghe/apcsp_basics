[1] Code:
Set list_of_integers to an empty list
Set all_even to boolean true
Iterate through the list list_of_integers, with the current element being represented as number:
    If number % 2 isn't equal to 0:
        Set all_even to boolean false
If all_even is true:
    Print "All even"
Else:
    Print "Not all even"

[2] This algorithm has a linearithmic time complexity, as more code is executed as you increase the size of the list.
    The algorithm is efficient, but will become less efficient as there is a moderate growth rate in steps as more integers are added.
