Starting Code:
1. Set sum to 0
2. Set counter to 0
3. While counter < n:
    a. Add counter to sum
    b. Increment counter by 1

[1] The variable counter starts at 0.
    The while loop only adds every positive integer before n, and doesn't include it.

[2] Fixed Code:
1. Set sum to 0
2. Set counter to 1
3. While counter <= n:
    a. Add counter to sum
    b. Increment counter by 1

[3] When n = 5, the variable sum equals 15.
