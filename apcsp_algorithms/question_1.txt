Starting Code:
1. Set x to 5
2. Set y to 10
3. Repeat the following steps until x = y:
    a. Add 1 to x
    b. Subtract 2 from y
4. Output the values of x and y

[1] I think the values of x and y will be 7 and 6 respectively.

[2] Modified Code:
1. Set x to 5
2. Set y to 10
3. Repeat the following steps until x &gt; y:
    a. Add 1 to x
    b. Subtract 2 from y
    c. Output the values of x and y
4. Output the values of x and y
